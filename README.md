# PHSX815_Week1
Editing the readme.

Yoni Brande

1st year graduate student

Lots of programming experience, undergrad compsci minor/most research in computational astrophysics.

Nothing specific in the course looks like it'll be an issue, but I haven't done anything with machine learning.

# Week 2
Modified the python example to write random numbers to a file (random_writing.py), then another script to read the numbers and plot them (random_reading.py).
